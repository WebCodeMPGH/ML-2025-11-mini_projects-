# üçÑ Mushroom Classification Project

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to classify mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous** using the [Mushroom Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification).

## üìÇ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Checked for missing values (**none found**).
- Checked for duplicate rows (**none found**).
- Explored class distribution ‚Üí data is already balanced, so **no SMOTE** needed.
- Encoded categorical features using **LabelEncoder**.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized **class distribution** using Seaborn.
- Generated **feature correlation heatmap**.
- Ranked **feature importance** using Random Forest.

### 3. Modeling Approaches

#### **A. Deep Learning Approach**
- Built an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** with `TensorFlow/Keras`.
- Added **Dropout layers** & **L2 regularization** to prevent overfitting.
- Used **EarlyStopping** to optimize training.
- Evaluated accuracy on test data.

#### **B. Classical Machine Learning Approach**
- Models tested:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Logistic Regression
- **Grid Search + Cross Validation** for hyperparameter tuning.
- Compared test accuracy with ANN.

### 4. Results
- Final comparison between ANN and the best classical model to find the most efficient method for mushroom classification.
