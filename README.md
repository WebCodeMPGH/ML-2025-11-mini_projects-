# 📊 Mohammad Parham – AI & Data Science Projects

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I focus on **practical, monetizable AI and Data Science** with an emphasis on **clear learning roadmaps, hands-on coding, and real-world datasets**.

## 🧠 About Me

- Passionate about **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**
- Prefer **practical, monetizable projects** over pure theory
- Love **clean code with clear explanations**  
- Tools I use often:  
  `Python` · `TensorFlow/Keras` · `Scikit-Learn` · `Pandas` · `Matplotlib`  
- Comfortable working in **Command Prompt (cmd)** and automating workflows

## 🔍 Main Learning Focus

1. **Data Handling & Preprocessing**
   - Working with CSV files using Pandas
   - Converting `DataFrame` to `tf.data.Dataset`
   - Data batching, shuffling, and prefetching for performance

2. **Neural Networks**
   - Building fully connected (Dense) models from scratch
   - Architectures: 3–5 layers
   - Dropout for regularization
   - Optimizers: SGD, Adam, RMSprop (comparisons and use cases)
   - Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Leaky ReLU, Softmax

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Confusion Matrix & Classification Report
   - Error analysis by class type
   - Accuracy/Loss visualization per epoch

4. **Overfitting Control**
   - EarlyStopping & ModelCheckpoint callbacks
   - Adjusting neurons per layer
   - Comparing model performance visually

## 📌 My Philosophy
> Learn by doing — theory is useful, but **real datasets and working code** teach faster.  
I keep my code **simple, explained, and ready to monetize**.
